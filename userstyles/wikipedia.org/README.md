# Wikipedia Dark Mode - Eye Care

> User styles for `wikipedia.org` and related sites

Wikipedia dark mode EyeCare. Styles respect manually (via `styles=""`) specified colors of various widgets, maths, pre/code tags, infoboxes and other tags etc.

It supports `wikipedia` / `wiktionary` / `wikimedia` / `wikibooks`

It supports multiple languages. So far I've checked __en__, __ru__, __de__, __fr__, es national wikis.

## Usability

As of version of 1.3.5 it was mostly suitable for reading. Editing is possible though, but some bugs may become evident.
